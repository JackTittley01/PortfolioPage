I have created a portfolio page that employers can visit to see my projects, experience and contact me.

The website is created so that all of the content is in one page, and there is navigation that can help to view the page.

On smaller screens, there wis a menu button that will toggle a dropdown with the different links to other parts of the site. 
The projects will show in rows of 1 or 2 depending on size.

On larger screens, the links will be in the top right of the page.
The projects will be in rows of 3 or 4 and the contact form input text is larger so that it can still be read.

The page features multiple animations to make it feel better to use.
A short sentence will be animated once the page loads and is made to look like typing.
After pressing the menu button, the dropdown will smoothly move into view. 
The page will smoothly scroll into view of the section the user chooses.

In my projects section there are pictures and links to any projects I have created and a link to their github pages.
In the experience section I will put any past work or education I have done and a list all of the skills I have learned.
The contact section features a form the user can use to send a message to my email inbox, which will be sent using [formspree](https://formspree.io/).
In the footer there is the current date which is fetched through an api call to the [worldtimeapi](http://worldtimeapi.org/), my email address, and a link to my github account.
